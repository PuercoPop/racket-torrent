Very basic torrent client as a way to learn Racket.

* TODO
- Announcing/Peer requesting:
  - Throught UDP trackers (only HTTP right now).
  - Use Magnet URIs in addition to torrent files.
- Upload to peers.
- Consider multiple trackers.
- Proper exception handling.
- Proper logging (the current output is basically pure noise)
- Unreinvent all the wheels as I learn how to write idiomatic Racket.
- More test (only a very small subset of function is covered).
